      <li>
        <strong> Prepare the sugar syrup</strong>
        <p>
          To make this simple Gulab jamun recipe, you need to take a vessel and
          add sugar, water and a slice of lemon. Mix the sugar syrup well and
          reduce the consistency to two-string. Then turn off the flame and let
          it attain normal room temperature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the dough for Gulab Jamun </strong>
        <p>
          Take a wide tray and add equal proportions of chenna or paneer and
          khoya, mash them together using a masher. To accentuate the taste add
          some saffron strands. Make sure that there are no lumps in the
          mixture. Once the mixture is smooth enough, move on to the next step.
          Mix, all-purpose flour, cardamom powder, cornflour and baking powder
          in the khoya-paneer mixture. To make the gulab jamun more delicious,
          add some ghee to the mix. This will leave a nice aroma and give it an
          authentic taste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the dough in small balls</strong>
        <p>
          Now, rub some ghee in your palms and take some dough and shape them
          into small balls. In the meantime, put a kadhai over medium flame and
          heat oil for frying. Once the oil is hot enough, slowly slide the
          balls and let them cook. Wait till the balls turn golden brown in
          colour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Soak the fried balls in Gulab Jamun</strong>
        <p>
          Take out the balls and remove the excess oil, then gently leave the
          gulab jamun balls in the sugar syrup. Let the Gulab Jamuns absorb the
          syrup. After half an hour, extract them and place them in a bowl and
          gently pour some sugar syrup.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish with dry fruits</strong>
        <p>
          Last, but not the least, garnish the gulab jamuns with some finely
          chopped pistachios. Serve these gulab jamuns after an elaborate and we
          are sure your guests will praise your culinary skills.
