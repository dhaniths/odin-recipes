    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>

    <p>
      Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of
      chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer
      of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender
      texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and
      fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken
      bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics
      it's marinated in.

    <h4>Steps to Follow</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak 300g basmati rice in warm water, then wash in cold until the water
        runs clear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 25g butter in a saucepan and cook 1 finely sliced large onion with
        1 bay leaf, 3 cardamom pods and 1 small cinnamon stick for 10 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle in 1 tsp turmeric, then add 4 chicken breasts, cut into large
        chunks, and 4 tbsp curry paste. Cook until aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the rice into the pan with 85g raisins, then pour over 850ml
        chicken stock. Place a tight-fitting lid on the pan and bring to a hard

        mins.
