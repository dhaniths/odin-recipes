    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Chana dal and grated coconut paste</strong>
        <p>
          To make this amazing soup recipe, grind together roasted chana dal and
          grated coconut. Make a smooth paste out of them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> cook the Trotters/ Paya for 10 minutes</strong>
        <p>
          Wash the trotters/paya thoroughly with running water and transfer it
          to a pressure cooker. Add turmeric powder, cardamom, salt, and black
          peppercorns to it. Pour 5 cups of water and allow the mixture to
          pressure cook for about 10 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the masala for the soup</strong>
        <p>
          In the meanwhile, you can prepare the masala for the soup. Heat oil in
          a frying pan and add chopped onions and green chilies to it. Cook
          until the onions turn translucent. Next, stir in ginger and garlic
          paste. Let the mixture fry for 30 seconds or so. Then, add tomatoes,
          red chili powder, and the ground coconut and chana dal paste prepared
          in step 1. Cook the entire amalgamation till it discharges oil. Remove
          from heat.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the masala and the trotters</strong>
        <p>
          By now, the trotters would have been cooked. Open the pressure cooker
          and add the masala to it. After this, again pressure cook the mixture
          for about 10 minutes. Once done, open the lid of the cooker and allow
          the shorba to cool.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Check the consistency and enjoy</strong>
        <p>
          You can adjust the consistency of the soup according to your will. If
          you want it to be watery, add water and bring to boil. Lastly, add
          garam masala powder and chopped coriander leaves. Let the soup cook on
          low flame until oil starts floating at the surface. Remove from the
          flame and enjoy hot and fresh.
